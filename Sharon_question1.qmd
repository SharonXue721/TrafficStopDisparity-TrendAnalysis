# Question 1

-   Is there evidence that traffic stops disproportionately target men?

-   Are certain cities/locations “balanced” in terms of how traffic stops reflect the demography of that city/location?

## Setup

-   **Techniques:** 

    ::: {style="font-size:80%"}
    -   **Proportion calculation**: For each state, we computed the proportion of traffic stops attributed to a particular group (e.g., male drivers or stops per state), and compared it to the corresponding group’s share of the licensed driver population.

    -   **Spatial visualization (Choropleth map)**: We used spatial visualizations to map the differences between stop and license proportions across states. This allowed for quick identification of geographic patterns in over- or under-representation.
    :::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: notes
-   Although raw percentage differences between proportions provide intuitive insights, they fail to account for varying state population sizes. 

-   It’s especially useful when sample sizes are large and traditional hypothesis testing (e.g., p-values) becomes overly sensitive.
:::

-   **Techniques**:

    -   **Cohen’s h (Effect Size)**: statistically measure the difference between two proportions, independent of sample size. 

        $$
        h = 2 \cdot \arcsin(\sqrt{p_1}) - 2 \cdot \arcsin(\sqrt{p_2})
        $$

        -   Interpretation Thresholds

            <div>

            ::: {style="font-size:70%"}
            | Cohen's *h* Range | Interpretation        |
            |-------------------|-----------------------|
            | h \< 0.20         | Negligible difference |
            | 0.20 \< h \< 0.50 | Small effect          |
            | 0.50 \< h \< 0.80 | Medium effect         |
            | h \> 0.80         | Large effect          |
            :::

            </div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Workflow**

    -   **Datascope**: Focused on overlapping time period (2014–2015) across major U.S. states. For each year, calculate the proportions(male stops, male drivers; licensed drivers proportion in the whole US for each state, stop proportion of the whole US for each state)

    -   **Visualization**: Generate choropleth maps to visualize geographic differences in stop vs. license proportions.

    -   **Cohen’s** **h**: to statistically measure the difference

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Results

Is there evidence that traffic stops disproportionately target men?

-   Whole US 

    -   ::: {style="font-size:80%"}
        Male_stop_proportion = 66.534%

-   State level

    -   All states show positive gaps → more men are stopped than expected.

    -   Similar pattern for both years.

The 32 states with complete data all show positive gaps

Especially for Pennsylvania (27.43%), Rhode Island (22.32%) and North Dakota (21.45%)

2015 shares the similar pattern.

Pennsylvania (25.48%) still held the largest difference, followed by Rhode Island (22.85%) and Massachusetts (20.02%)

Key Takeaways

-   **Nationwide Trend:** Most states, as well as the U.S. overall, show **mild overrepresentation of male drivers** in traffic stops compared to their share of licensed drivers.

-   **Balanced States:** Only **Nevada (NV)** and **Kansas (KS)** show **gender-balanced enforcement**, with male stop rates aligning closely with male driver proportions.

-   **High Overstop State:** **Pennsylvania (PA)** exhibits a **notably higher overstop rate** for male drivers.

Real-world Takeaways

-   **Operational Patterns:** The mild overstop of male drivers may be linked to **driving behavior patterns**

-   **Most states are statistically balanced** in terms of traffic stop proportions vs. licensed driver proportions.

-   **Only a few states** showed *mild imbalance* across both years, These imbalances are small in magnitude and may have limited real-world impact.

-   **No strong evidence of systemic geographic bias** in traffic stops across states

-   **Small imbalances may reflect local operational factors** (e.g., highway traffic, policing resource allocation)
